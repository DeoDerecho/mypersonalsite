          <h3>Driving</h3>
          <p>I consider driving as one of the most important skills to learn either you have your own car or you dont't. It is a very flexible skills as it can be used for either traveling with your family or friends, just your leisure time, or it can be one factor in your work. Either way it still needs a lot of responsibility. </p>

          <h3>Playing with my Doggo</h3>
          <p>His name is Peanut. He seems kinda cute and innocent, but you have no idea how annoying and aggressive that dogs is. He really hates the water delivery guy and the kid who's just going to buy at the nearby store. He just barks for no reason and really loves tearing slippers. But I really love that dog so gosh damn much. </p>

          <h3>Gaming</h3>
          <p>Aside from developing cognitive skills, video games are also proven to feature manual skills development. The ability of video games to develop a wide variety of skills is interesting for education or training providers, particularly when trying to teach difficult to engage groups of people.</p>
